## Products

This folder contain the following 
files in ascending order.

1. DisplayProducts.js

This component have attached two more
files `ProductsItem.js` in the **Component** folder.

And `FilterProductsWithCategory.js` this file
display the categories and render products
data according to the *Category*.

### Excluded files

`Categories.js` and `CategorizedProducts` are not more in use but 
one feature I want to have (after clicking on category should show total no. of products).
So, far leaving this.

### Other files

`SpecificProduct.js` is the detail of a one/specific product.

`ShopProducts.js` display the all products
of relative shop.
